# Specification Quality Checklist: codeconv-runner

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- "Implementation details" deliberately appear in this spec (npm package names like `proper-lockfile`, file extensions like `.mjs`, schema names like `dbos`/`codeconv`, technology names like DBOS / SQLAlchemy / psycopg / Npgsql / psqlODBC). They are retained because (a) the user input explicitly named them as binding constraints ("DBOS with PGLite backing", "exactly as in hatzinor/ulpani and BREENDEV/aigrid opskit-init"), (b) they are *substrate* — the prereq-pattern this feature evolves is itself defined in those terms, and removing them would make the spec unfaithful to the user's stated intent. The Content-Quality check is interpreted under that exception. Pure free-floating implementation details (file layout inside the Python package, internal class names, data-types beyond what the spec needs to be testable) are NOT introduced in the spec.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
